# Aaron Lamb's Technical Blog

**Live Site:** [https://alamb-hex.github.io](https://alamb-hex.github.io)

I write about real problems I'm solving and lessons from actual project work. No theory - just what actually worked (or didn't) when building things.

**What I'm working on:**
- Building AI agents and tools (RAG systems, context management, semantic search)
- Cybersecurity consulting (infrastructure hardening, compliance, MSP support)
- Developer tooling (Git-based CMS, AI-friendly interfaces, automation)
- Bootstrap business growth (referrals, content, building without VC funding)

**What you'll find here:**
- Implementation details with code
- Lessons from client projects (sanitized for public consumption)
- Architecture decisions and why I made them
- Things that didn't work (so you don't waste time on them)
- Patterns worth reusing

## About Me

I run Hexaxia Technologies - cybersecurity consulting, infrastructure engineering, and AI product development. Based between the US and Trinidad. Building tools for MSPs and SMBs while helping construction/manufacturing companies secure their infrastructure.

Nearly 30 years in the industry, with 23 years as a consultant. I've spent my career in systems administration, network engineering, and infrastructure security. Now I build things and write about what I learn.
